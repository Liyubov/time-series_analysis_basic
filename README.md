# Basic time-series analysis
Here we describe basic time-series analysis tools.
The main goal is to show how one can use simple mathematical tools for time-series analysis. 

# Main steps and table of content

Here we discuss some main tools of time-series analysis 

    Loading data or generating random sample of data
    Visualizing time series data using standard or spectral approaches
    Moving average, Rolling windows
    Seasonality, Frequencies, Trends in data time-series on detection of seasonality applying simple Fourier transform
    Autocorrelation autocorrelation analysis in order to detect memory effects
    Correlation vs. causation applicable to several time-series in order to detect similarities and "causes"
